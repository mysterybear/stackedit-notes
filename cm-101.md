# Code-mentoring 101

## Expectations

* Falling out of and then coming back to coding is fine and normal
* Learning curves can be steep
* Best to have _high aims/objectives_ but _low expectations_
* It's good to have some projects/objectives set out

## Objectives

* Web prototyping for our projects

## Tooling

~~struck through~~ = can be de-prioritised for now, will cover much later on if at all

### React

#### Build (project scaffolding) Tools
* create-react-app
* next.js (next CLI)
* ~~gatsby.js (gatsby CLI)~~

#### Animation
* framer-motion
* ~~react-spring~~
* ~~react-motion~~

#### CSS in our React Projects
* regular CSS (and CSS Modules)
* styled-components
* tailwind

## Questions

### I have many boxes (div's); they're all the same width and height; they're all a different background color; how do think about styling these?

This is a great question, touching upon the ["DRY" principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). There are several ways to address the problem, though they will boil down similarly, since there are only two ways to style elements:

1. by applying a class e.g. `<div class="foo">...</div>` in HTML, or `<div className="foo" />` in JSX [(read this!)]([https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html))
2. by adding inline styling e.g. `<div style="background-color: pink">...</div>` in HTML or `<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'pink' }} />` in JSX

The word "class" itself implies some generality. This is what CSS classes are for; they define "classes" of styles that can be shared. They're a way of grouping styles together.

We can think of a "style"  as being a singular property-value pairing, e.g. `width: 10px`.

We can think of a "class" as... well I think of it as the top line and the braces:

```
.width-10-height-10 {
	width: 10px;
	height: 10px;
}
```

Whereas I think of the stuff _inside_ the braces as styles.

So, we should definitely define styles that are shared in common amongst elements in terms of classes, as in the last code example



## Framer Motion

[Where possible, prefer to animate transforms and opacity](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/component/#transform)

## Homework

We "got started" with create-react-app and framer-motion during our session.

Try "getting started" with any of these tools/libraries that we mentioned but didn't get to cover in session:

* [https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started)
* [https://tailwindcss.com/screencasts/](https://tailwindcss.com/screencasts/)
* [https://styled-components.com/docs/basics](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics)

(I've struck through, ~~like this~~,  the tools/libraries above that we can safely cast aside for the time being)

I'd also recommend signing up for and following along with [Dan Abramov's Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/)
