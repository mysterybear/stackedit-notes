# Code-mentoring 101

## Expectations

* Falling out of and then coming back to coding is fine and normal
* Learning curves can be steep
* Best to have _high aims/objectives_ but _low expectations_
* It's good to have some projects/objectives set out

## Objectives

* Web prototyping for our projects

## Tooling

~~struck through~~ = can be de-prioritised for now, will cover much later on if at all

### React

#### Build (project scaffolding) Tools
* create-react-app
* next.js (next CLI)
* ~~gatsby.js (gatsby CLI)~~

#### Animation
* framer-motion
* ~~react-spring~~
* ~~react-motion~~

#### CSS in our React Projects
* regular CSS (and CSS Modules)
* styled-components
* tailwind

## Questions

### I have many boxes (div's); they're all the same width and height; they're all a different background color; how do think about styling these?

This is a great question, touching upon the ["DRY" principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). There are several ways to address the problem, though they will boil down similarly, since there are only two ways to style elements:

1. by applying a class e.g. `<div class="foo">...</div>` in HTML, or `<div className="foo" />` in JSX [(read this!)]([https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html))
2. by adding inline styling e.g. `<div style="background-color: pink">...</div>` in HTML or `<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'pink' }} />` in JSX

The word "class" itself implies some generality. This is what CSS classes are for; they define "classes" of styles that can be shared. They're a way of grouping styles together.

We can think of a "style"  as being a singular property-value pairing, e.g. `width: 10px`.

We can think of a "class" as... well I think of it as the top line and the braces:

```
.width-10-height-10 {
	width: 10px;
	height: 10px;
}
```

Whereas I think of the stuff _inside_ the braces as styles.

So, we should definitely define styles that are shared in common amongst elements in terms of classes, as in the last code snippet.

But then how to give each element a different color? If you're just working with an arbitrary list of colors off the top of your head, then you actually have to do this manually! It doesn't matter too much whether you apply inline styles with the `style` attribute, or whether you define a class in your CSS file and then apply it with the `className` attribute; you're still going to have to define each color somewhere!

If you're going to re-use that color, then there's good reason to define a class. If it's definitely a one-off, then there's an argument to use an inline style.

To finish, here is an example of importing the well-known Material Design color palette, iterating over the colors, grabbing the "400" color (as each color has a range from 0 and then rendering as many 100x100px div's, setting each one's background color as a color from the palette:

 

## Framer Motion

[Where possible, prefer to animate transforms and opacity](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/component/#transform)

## Homework

We "got started" with create-react-app and framer-motion during our session.

Try "getting started" with any of these tools/libraries that we mentioned but didn't get to cover in session:

* [https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started)
* [https://tailwindcss.com/screencasts/](https://tailwindcss.com/screencasts/)
* [https://styled-components.com/docs/basics](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics)

(I've struck through, ~~like this~~,  the tools/libraries above that we can safely cast aside for the time being)

I'd also recommend signing up for and following along with [Dan Abramov's Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/)
